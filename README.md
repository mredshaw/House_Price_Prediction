# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves building a regression model to predict house prices in King County based on various features available in the dataset. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model and explain the key drivers of house prices.

## Data
The dataset includes information on house sales in King County, such as:
- House features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Sale price
- Date of sale
- Location information

## Tasks
1. **Build a Regression Model:**
   - Choose between Ordinary Least Squares Regression, LASSO, Ridge, or Elastic Net.
   - Clean and transform the data, including feature engineering, creating dummy variables, or using dimensionality reduction.
   - Explain the chosen approach and why it is the best for the provided data.

2. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Use evaluation techniques covered in class to assess the model's performance.
   - Explain the results and justify why this is the best model given the tools available.

3. **Explain the Results:**
   - Present the results in a way that a business executive can understand.
   - Identify the main drivers of house prices in King County and quantify their impact.
